#there is no need to declare and initialize variables in python, all you need to do is create and use the variable by assigning a value/string etc to it.
name = input("what is your name? ") #name = varaible name
print(name)
length = len(name) #length = varaiable name. len function is used to calculate the length of the input
print(length)
